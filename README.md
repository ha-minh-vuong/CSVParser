CSVParser
========

A CSV Parser for iOS and OSX.

It can parse csv file into an array of arrays or an array of dictionaries.

The csv file can contain single quote <code>'</code> or double quote <code>"</code>.

Usage
-----

Adding <code>CSVParser.h</code> and <code>CSVParser.m</code> to your Xcode project.


1. Import the CSVParser class header:

```objective-c
#import "CSVParser.h"
```

2. Create an array from file:

```objective-c
NSArray *arrayOfArrays = [CSVParser parseCSVIntoArrayOfArraysFromFile:filePath
                                         withSeparatedCharacterString:@","
                                                 quoteCharacterString:nil]; // nil, if csv dont have quote.

NSArray *arrayOfDictionaries = [CSVParser parseCSVIntoArrayOfDictionariesFromFile:filePath
                                                     withSeparatedCharacterString:@","
                                                             quoteCharacterString:@"\""]; // if csv contains ".
```

Example
-------

Assume you have a csv file:

```csv
name,email,address
"Lucky Star",lucky@abc.com,"1A street"
"Joe A",joe@abc.com,"2B street"
```

Array of arrays:

```objective-c
NSArray *arrayOfArrays = [CSVParser parseCSVIntoArrayOfArraysFromFile:filePath
                                         withSeparatedCharacterString:@","
                                                 quoteCharacterString:@"\""];

//    (("name","email","address"),
//     ("Lucky Star","lucky@abc.com","1A street"),
//     ("Joe A","joe@abc.com","2B street"))
```

Array of dictionaries:

```objective-c
NSArray *arrayOfDictionaries = [CSVParser parseCSVIntoArrayOfDictionariesFromFile:filePath
                                                     withSeparatedCharacterString:@","
                                                             quoteCharacterString:@"\""];

//    ({"name" = "Lucky Star";
//      "email" = "lucky@abc.com";
//      "address" = "1A street";},
//     {"name" = "Joe A";
//      "email" = "joe@abc.com";
//      "address" = "2B street";})
```
